## Purpose

Defines a keyed reclaim table that stores one value per key as `any`, survives context cancel when the same key is opened again within grace, and cancels the incarnation lifetime when it is not. The table lives in `reclaim` and is reusable across packages. Callers type-assert. Yaegi cannot instantiate `Table[T]` from another package; this table is not generic.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Table file depends only on the Go standard library
The `Table` source file SHALL import only Go standard-library packages. It MUST NOT import this module’s plugin, e2e, or vendor packages. It MUST store `any`. It MUST NOT be a generic `Table[T]` instantiated as `otherpkg.Table[*T]` (Yaegi panics or fails import).

#### Scenario: Stdlib-only imports
- **WHEN** `table.go` is listed for imports
- **THEN** every import path is a Go standard-library package

### Requirement: Process table is a singleton
`reclaim` SHALL expose one process-wide table (`Default` / package `Open`). Independent keys on that table MUST NOT share an incarnation. Callers in other packages SHALL type-assert the value `Open` returns.

#### Scenario: Default Open shares one incarnation
- **WHEN** `Open` and `Default().Open` are called for the same key
- **THEN** both return the same stored value
- **AND** `create` runs once

### Requirement: Open creates once and binds a context
`Open(ctx, key, logger, create, hooks)` SHALL create the value on the first call for a key, store
it, store `hooks` on that incarnation, and bind `ctx` as a holder. `Open` SHALL panic if `ctx` is
nil. `Open` SHALL return an error if `logger` is nil. The table MUST NOT keep a logger of its own;
`logger` is the only logger for that Open. A holder whose `Done` is nil (`context.Background`)
SHALL be treated as live until `ctx.Err()` is set. `create` SHALL take no arguments (Yaegi cannot
call `func(context.Context) (any, error)`). The table SHALL register the key before it runs
`create`, so concurrent first `Open` calls for one key run `create` exactly once and every caller
receives that one value; no `Open` SHALL create a value that is then discarded. If `create`
returns an error the key SHALL NOT be stored, every caller waiting on that create SHALL receive
that error, and a later `Open` SHALL be free to try again. A later `Open` for the same key (live
or sleeping) SHALL return the stored value, bind the new context, and MUST NOT run `create`. Two
live contexts on one key SHALL keep the value until both are Done. A stale holder drop from a
previous incarnation or from `Reset` MUST NOT change a later incarnation of the same key.

#### Scenario: Two holders one dispose
- **WHEN** `Open` creates a value for a key
- **AND** a second `Open` attaches another live context to that key
- **THEN** the incarnation does not end while either context is not Done

#### Scenario: Second create dispose is ignored
- **WHEN** a key already has an incarnation
- **AND** `Open` is called again
- **THEN** `create` does not run
- **AND** the stored value is the one returned

#### Scenario: Concurrent first Opens run create once
- **WHEN** two first `Open` calls for the same key race
- **THEN** `create` runs exactly once
- **AND** both calls return that one value
- **AND** no value is created and then discarded

#### Scenario: Create error reaches every waiting caller
- **WHEN** two first `Open` calls for the same key race and `create` returns an error
- **THEN** both calls return that error
- **AND** nothing is stored for that key
- **AND** a later `Open` for that key runs `create` again

#### Scenario: Missing context panics
- **WHEN** `Open` is called with a nil context
- **THEN** `Open` panics

#### Scenario: Nil logger is rejected
- **WHEN** `Open` is called with a nil logger
- **THEN** `Open` returns an error
- **AND** no incarnation is stored

#### Scenario: Nil-Done holder stays live until Err is set
- **WHEN** `Open` binds a holder whose `Done` is nil
- **AND** that holder has not set `Err`
- **THEN** the incarnation stays live
- **WHEN** that holder then sets `Err` without closing a `Done` channel
- **THEN** the table drops that holder

### Requirement: Cancel then open within grace does not dispose
When every bound context for a key is Done, the table SHALL put the stored value to sleep and
keep it for a grace period before it disposes of it. If the same key is opened again with a live
context before grace ends, the table SHALL wake that value and MUST NOT dispose of it. That
reclaim MUST NOT run `create` again.

#### Scenario: Reclaim before grace
- **WHEN** all contexts for a key are Done
- **AND** a new `Open` for that key occurs before grace ends
- **THEN** the incarnation is not disposed
- **AND** the new context is tracked
- **AND** the stored value is returned awake

#### Scenario: Grace elapses without rebind
- **WHEN** all contexts for a key are Done
- **AND** no `Open` for that key occurs during grace
- **THEN** the incarnation is disposed once

### Requirement: Keys are independent
Canceling the lifetime of one key MUST NOT cancel the lifetime of another key.

#### Scenario: One key times out
- **WHEN** key A’s contexts are all Done and grace elapses
- **AND** key B still has a live context
- **THEN** only key A’s lifetime is canceled

### Requirement: Grace is configurable
Grace SHALL be how long a **sleeping** value is kept before it is disposed. Because a sleeping
value has released what is expensive to hold idle, a long grace is cheap: the reason to keep it
long is that a sleeping value costs little, not that reloads are fast. The table SHALL use a
caller-supplied grace duration. A zero grace SHALL dispose of the value as soon as the last
holder is gone, with no sleeping window at all. A negative grace SHALL become the product default
of 10 seconds. Default grace in this product SHALL be 10 seconds (`DefaultGrace`) when the
process table is constructed.

#### Scenario: Default grace
- **WHEN** a table is created with a negative grace
- **THEN** grace is 10 seconds

#### Scenario: Zero grace
- **WHEN** a table is created with a zero grace
- **AND** the last holder context is Done
- **THEN** the value is slept and disposed without waiting
- **AND** the key is not left stored
- **AND** the key stayed stored until close returned
- **AND** there was no window in which an `Open` could wake that value

### Requirement: Lifecycle events are logged
The table SHALL emit a structured log line for each of: incarnation created (`Open` create),
holder attached, last holder gone and the value put to sleep (orphan), a sleeping value woken by
an `Open` (reclaim), and incarnation disposed. Each line MUST include the key. Message strings
SHALL be stable package constants (`reclaim_put`, `reclaim_bind`, `reclaim_orphan`,
`reclaim_reclaim`, `reclaim_dispose`). All five messages SHALL be logged at debug. Put, bind, and
reclaim SHALL use the logger passed to the `Open` that caused them. Orphan and dispose SHALL use
the logger from the last `Open` that bound that key. `Reset` SHALL emit `reclaim_dispose` for
each disposed key using that slot's last Open logger, preceded by `reclaim_orphan` when that
incarnation was still awake. Log lines MUST NOT be emitted while the table mutex is held.

Every line SHALL mean the work it names has already happened: `reclaim_orphan` is emitted after
`sleep` has returned, `reclaim_reclaim` after `wake` has returned, and `reclaim_dispose` after
the Close hook has returned (or immediately when that func is nil). For one incarnation
`reclaim_orphan` SHALL always precede the `reclaim_dispose` that ends it, at every grace duration
including zero, with no exception for `Reset`.

At zero grace the table keeps no sleeping value, so an `Open` that races the last holder going
away SHALL be logged as a new incarnation (`reclaim_put` then `reclaim_bind`), not as
`reclaim_reclaim`. That new incarnation's `create` SHALL NOT start until Close of the previous
incarnation has returned, so `reclaim_dispose` for the previous incarnation SHALL precede
`reclaim_put` of the next.

#### Scenario: Hash change orphan then dispose
- **WHEN** key A is opened, then all of A's contexts are Done
- **AND** key B is opened (new incarnation) before or after A is put to sleep
- **AND** A is not opened again during grace
- **THEN** logs include create A, bind A, orphan A, create B, bind B, and dispose A
- **AND** dispose A occurs only after grace for A
- **AND** B is not disposed

#### Scenario: Orphan precedes dispose at a short grace
- **WHEN** a table with a grace shorter than a millisecond has its last holder for a key go Done
- **AND** the grace elapses and the incarnation is disposed
- **THEN** the recorded order for that key is `reclaim_orphan` then `reclaim_dispose`

#### Scenario: Zero grace open racing the drop is a plain bind
- **WHEN** a table with zero grace has its last holder for a key go Done
- **AND** an `Open` for that key races that drop
- **THEN** that `Open` records `reclaim_put` and `reclaim_bind` for the key
- **AND** it does not record `reclaim_reclaim`
- **AND** `reclaim_dispose` for the previous incarnation is recorded before that `reclaim_put`

#### Scenario: Reset logs orphan then dispose
- **WHEN** `Reset` is called on a table that still has a live incarnation
- **THEN** logs include `reclaim_orphan` then `reclaim_dispose` for that key
- **AND** a later `Open` of the same key creates a new incarnation that a stale holder drop MUST NOT dispose

#### Scenario: Open logger level gates put and dispose
- **WHEN** `Open` is called with a logger whose handler level is debug
- **THEN** `reclaim_put` is emitted at debug
- **WHEN** that incarnation is later disposed
- **THEN** `reclaim_dispose` is emitted at debug
- **WHEN** `Open` is called with a logger whose handler level is info
- **THEN** `reclaim_put` and `reclaim_dispose` are not emitted

### Requirement: Incarnation end closes the stored value before it reports the end
When an incarnation ends (grace elapsed while sleeping, `Reset`, or a zero-grace drop), the table
SHALL call the Close hook when that func is non-nil and SHALL wait until it has returned before
it emits `reclaim_dispose`. The Close hook SHALL be called at most once per incarnation. Because
the table waits, a Close hook that blocks blocks whoever ended the incarnation; Close hooks
SHALL NOT block. Every goroutine the table starts for a key SHALL exit once that key's holder
contexts are Done and its incarnation has ended.

On the zero-grace drop path and when grace elapses, the table SHALL keep the key stored until
Close has returned, so a concurrent `Open` for that key waits for Close instead of creating while
it is in flight. After Close returns the key SHALL NOT be stored. Close SHALL NOT run while the
table mutex is held. The Close window SHALL NOT be a sleeping window: an `Open` that arrives
during Close MUST NOT wake the ending incarnation.

Tests-only `Reset` MAY unmap first. Callers MUST NOT race `Reset` with `Open` on the same key.

#### Scenario: Dispose log implies Close has returned
- **WHEN** a key is orphaned and grace elapses
- **AND** the Close hook is set
- **THEN** that func has returned before `reclaim_dispose` is emitted for that key
- **AND** that func did not observe a dispose line already written for that key

#### Scenario: Reset closes the value before it reports dispose
- **WHEN** `Reset` is called on a table that still has an incarnation
- **AND** the Close hook is set
- **THEN** that func has returned before `reclaim_dispose` is emitted for that key

#### Scenario: Cancellable holders do not park a waiter for the hold
- **WHEN** many keys are opened with holder contexts whose `Done` is non-nil
- **AND** those contexts are still live
- **THEN** the table owns no more goroutines than it did before those `Open` calls

#### Scenario: Goroutines do not outlive the incarnation
- **WHEN** many keys are opened, then every holder context is Done and every incarnation has ended
- **THEN** the table owns no more goroutines than it did before those `Open` calls

#### Scenario: Create does not start while previous Close is in flight
- **WHEN** Close is in flight for a key (zero grace, or after grace elapsed)
- **AND** `Open` is called for that key
- **THEN** `create` does not run until Close has returned
- **AND** that `Open` does not reclaim the closing value

### Requirement: Library Open loads under Traefik Yaegi
A Traefik local plugin SHALL import this module's `reclaim` package and call `Open` from `New`
with `Hooks` that log sleep, wake, and close. Traefik SHALL start. A request through that plugin
SHALL succeed. Two plugin instances that Open the same key SHALL receive the same stored value.
Those hooks SHALL run under Yaegi. Inert hooks MUST NOT be accepted as success for this load.

#### Scenario: Fake plugin starts and shares one incarnation
- **WHEN** Traefik v3.7.11 loads a local plugin whose `New` calls `reclaim.Open` for a shared key
- **AND** two routes each construct that plugin
- **THEN** Traefik's API is reachable
- **AND** a request through each route succeeds
- **AND** both instances observe the same stored value identity
- **AND** Traefik logs include `reclaim_put` and `reclaim_bind`

#### Scenario: Reload runs sleep then wake hooks
- **WHEN** both plugin instances for that shared key are torn down and constructed again within grace
- **THEN** Traefik logs include `reclaim_orphan` and `reclaim_reclaim`
- **AND** Traefik logs include the plugin's sleep hook line and wake hook line

#### Scenario: Teardown runs the close hook
- **WHEN** every plugin instance for that shared key is torn down and grace elapses
- **THEN** Traefik logs include `reclaim_dispose`
- **AND** Traefik logs include the plugin's close hook line
