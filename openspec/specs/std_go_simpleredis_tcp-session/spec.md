## Purpose

Defines the stdlib TCP session a SimpleRedis client holds: `Init` records host, password, and database without dialing; the first command dials; AUTH and SELECT run once per dial; idle connections are pooled; `Close` drains the pool and blocks further dials. Callers import `simpleredis` from this module. The session loads under Traefik Yaegi from a nested fake plugin that Inits in `New`.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Session source depends only on the Go standard library
The SimpleRedis session source SHALL import only Go standard-library packages. It MUST NOT import this module’s plugin, e2e, or vendor packages. It MUST NOT import a Redis client module (`go-redis`, miniredis, or similar). It MUST NOT use `unsafe`, cgo, or type parameters. Retry jitter SHALL use `math/rand` (`Int63n`), which is standard library; it MUST NOT use `math/rand/v2`.

#### Scenario: Stdlib-only imports
- **WHEN** the SimpleRedis session source is listed for imports
- **THEN** every import path is a Go standard-library package

### Requirement: Package path is simpleredis
The session SHALL live in package `simpleredis` under folder `simpleredis/`. The import last segment MUST be `simpleredis`. The package clause MUST NOT be `redis`.

#### Scenario: Import last segment is simpleredis
- **WHEN** a caller imports the client from this module
- **THEN** the import path ends in `/simpleredis`

### Requirement: Init records settings and does not dial
`Init(host, pass, database)` SHALL store those three values on the client. `Init` MUST NOT open a TCP connection. Callers SHALL call `Init` once before concurrent use.

#### Scenario: Init does not open a socket
- **WHEN** `Init` is called with a host that refuses connections
- **THEN** `Init` returns without error
- **AND** no TCP connection is opened

### Requirement: First command dials TCP
The first `Get`, `MGet` (with at least one name), `Set`, or `Del` after `Init` SHALL dial `tcp` to the host stored by `Init`. The session MUST NOT dial a Unix socket and MUST NOT use TLS. Dial timeout SHALL be two seconds.

#### Scenario: Unreachable host
- **WHEN** a command is issued after `Init` with host `127.0.0.1:1`
- **THEN** the command returns an error whose `Error()` text is `redis:unreachable`

### Requirement: AUTH and SELECT run once per dial
When `pass` is non-empty, each new dial SHALL send `AUTH` with that password before other commands. When `database` is non-empty, each new dial SHALL send `SELECT` with that database before other commands. Subsequent commands on a reused connection MUST NOT send `AUTH` or `SELECT` again.

#### Scenario: Auth and select once per dial
- **WHEN** the client is Inited with a password and a database
- **AND** several Gets reuse one connection
- **THEN** AUTH and SELECT are sent once for that connection
- **AND** they are not sent again on those Gets

### Requirement: Idle connections are pooled
The session SHALL keep unused TCP connections in an idle pool of at most eight (`maxIdleConns`). Live sockets (idle plus checked out) SHALL not exceed `poolSize` (`liveCap()`; const default 8). When idle is empty and live sockets are already at `poolSize`, a caller SHALL wait for a released socket instead of dialing. A sequential burst of Gets on one client SHALL reuse one connection. Concurrent commands SHALL not open more than `poolSize` connections, including when more callers overlap than `poolSize`. An idle connection older than thirty seconds SHALL not be reused; the next command SHALL dial a new one if live sockets are under `poolSize`. Dirty sockets MUST NOT return to idle (`reusable=false`); that is not a retry. `release` MUST NOT close a reusable socket solely because the idle list is full while live sockets are under `poolSize`.

Every command (GET, MGET, SET, DEL, INCR, INCRBY, EXPIRE, EXPIREAT, EVAL) SHALL use go-redis-shaped command retry. Exported fields `MaxRetries`, `MinRetryBackoff`, and `MaxRetryBackoff` follow go-redis Options sentinels and MUST NOT be Init arguments: `0` means the default (3 extra retries, 8ms, 512ms); `-1` means off (no extra retries, no backoff sleep). The zero-value client therefore retries like go-redis. The retry loop SHALL be `for attempt := 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++` (default 3 means at most four sends). Backoff SHALL sleep only between retries (`attempt > 0`), using go-redis `RetryBackoff` (`math/rand` `Int63n` jitter). Init stays `Init(host, pass, database)`.

A command SHALL retry when the error is `redis:unreachable` (EOF, unexpected EOF, dial failure, and other IO as this client maps them), including a fresh dial, unless the client is `Close`d (`redis:unreachable` from a closed client MUST NOT spin `MaxRetries`). A command SHALL also retry Redis error replies whose text is `ERR max number of clients reached` or has prefix `LOADING `, `READONLY `, `MASTERDOWN `, `CLUSTERDOWN `, or `TRYAGAIN ` (space after the word). A command MUST NOT retry `redis:timeout` (documented deviation from go-redis: `ioTimeout` is one second; retrying would stall a Traefik request for several seconds), `redis:miss`, `redis:noauth`, `redis:issue?`, or other Redis `-ERR` replies. A pool-wait timeout SHALL return `redis:unreachable` and MUST NOT be retried, so `MaxRetries` does not multiply `poolTimeout`.

INCR, INCRBY, and EVAL MAY double-apply when a reply is lost and the command is retried. That is accepted. A timeout on a reused connection MUST NOT be retried for any verb.

#### Scenario: Sequential gets reuse one connection
- **WHEN** twenty-five Gets run one after another against a live fake Redis
- **THEN** the fake observes one TCP connection

#### Scenario: Concurrent commands stay within the pool
- **WHEN** eight concurrent commands run against a live fake Redis
- **THEN** the fake observes at most eight TCP connections

#### Scenario: Overlapping callers above poolSize do not dial past the live cap
- **WHEN** more concurrent commands than the default `poolSize` (8) overlap against a live fake Redis
- **THEN** the fake observes at most eight TCP connections
- **AND** waiters reuse a released socket rather than dialing past `poolSize`

#### Scenario: Lost-reply Incr is retried
- **WHEN** a client has an idle pooled connection
- **AND** the peer applies INCR then closes before writing the reply, once
- **AND** Incr is called once with default MaxRetries
- **THEN** Incr succeeds
- **AND** the stored value for that key is `2`
- **AND** the peer observes two INCR commands
- **AND** the peer observes a second TCP connection

#### Scenario: Lost-reply Incr with MaxRetries off
- **WHEN** a client has an idle pooled connection
- **AND** `MaxRetries` is `-1`
- **AND** the peer applies INCR then closes before writing the reply, once
- **AND** Incr is called once
- **THEN** Incr returns `redis:unreachable`
- **AND** the stored value for that key is `1`
- **AND** the peer observes only one INCR

#### Scenario: Lost-reply Eval is retried
- **WHEN** a client has an idle pooled connection
- **AND** the peer applies EVAL then closes before writing the reply, once
- **AND** Eval is called once with a Lua 5.1-safe script that lists its key in KEYS
- **THEN** Eval succeeds
- **AND** the stored script result is the value after two applies
- **AND** the peer observes two EVAL commands
- **AND** the peer observes a second TCP connection

#### Scenario: Lost-reply Get is retried
- **WHEN** a client has an idle pooled connection
- **AND** the peer closes before writing the GET reply
- **AND** Get is called
- **THEN** Get returns the stored bytes
- **AND** the peer observes a second GET on a new connection

### Requirement: Full pool wait returns redis:unreachable
When every live socket is checked out, a further command SHALL wait for a slot. If no slot frees before the pool wait (200 milliseconds) elapses, that command SHALL return an error whose `Error()` text is `redis:unreachable` and MUST NOT open another TCP connection. The wait MUST use only the Go standard library (no extra timer goroutine leak: stop the timer when a slot arrives). That timeout MUST NOT be retried.

#### Scenario: Pool wait times out
- **WHEN** all live sockets at the default `poolSize` (8) are busy
- **AND** another command is issued
- **AND** no socket becomes free within 200 milliseconds
- **THEN** that command returns `redis:unreachable`
- **AND** the fake or server observes no additional TCP connection for that command

### Requirement: Live cap is proven on Redis and Dragonfly
The session SHALL keep at most `poolSize` live TCP connections (idle plus in use; const default 8) against a real Redis and a real Dragonfly. Fake-server tests MUST NOT be the only proof. Traefik local-plugin Pester on `/redis` and `/dragonfly` SHALL overlap requests long enough to contend for sockets, observe at most `poolSize` clients on that backend (default 8), and observe `redis:unreachable` when a waiter exceeds the pool wait. Compiled tests gated on live addresses SHALL prove pool-wait `redis:unreachable` on both engines; they MAY set unexported `poolSize` so a shared CI Redis is not left in Lua BUSY. Any Lua used to hold a socket MUST be Lua 5.1-safe (no `table.maxn`) and MUST list touched keys in KEYS (zero keys when none are touched). Compose project `reclaim-e2e`, routes `/a` `/b`, and existing verb headers MUST keep their semantics.

#### Scenario: Concurrent holds stay within poolSize on Redis
- **WHEN** overlapping requests through the Traefik plugin hold sockets against compose Redis
- **THEN** Redis has at most eight established TCP clients from that plugin
- **AND** reclaim routes `/a` and `/b` still succeed

#### Scenario: Concurrent holds stay within poolSize on Dragonfly
- **WHEN** overlapping requests through the Traefik plugin hold sockets against compose Dragonfly
- **THEN** Dragonfly has at most eight established TCP clients from that plugin

#### Scenario: Extra waiter is redis:unreachable on both engines
- **WHEN** `poolSize` sockets (default 8) are held against Redis
- **AND** another request cannot obtain a socket before the pool wait
- **THEN** that request fails with `redis:unreachable`
- **WHEN** the same overlap is run against Dragonfly
- **THEN** that request fails with `redis:unreachable`

### Requirement: Close drains the pool and blocks redial
`Close` SHALL close idle pooled connections and mark the client closed. After `Close`, `Get`, `MGet`, `Set`, and `Del` SHALL return `redis:unreachable` and MUST NOT dial. `Close` SHALL be idempotent. In-flight commands MAY finish; their sockets SHALL be closed on release.

#### Scenario: Close drains idle and does not redial
- **WHEN** a client has an idle pooled connection
- **AND** `Close` is called
- **AND** a later Get is issued
- **THEN** that Get returns `redis:unreachable`
- **AND** no new TCP connection is opened

### Requirement: I/O deadline is timeout, not a net.Error assert
When a command hits an I/O deadline, the session SHALL return an error whose `Error()` text is `redis:timeout`. Mapping MUST use `errors.Is` against `os.ErrDeadlineExceeded`. The session MUST NOT type-assert `net.Error` (Yaegi has panicked on that assert across the interpreter boundary). `redis:timeout` MUST NOT be retried (documented deviation from go-redis; `ioTimeout` is one second). A timeout on a reused connection MUST NOT open a second connection.

#### Scenario: I/O timeout is redis:timeout
- **WHEN** the Redis peer does not complete a reply before the I/O deadline
- **THEN** the command returns `redis:timeout`

### Requirement: Library Init loads under Traefik Yaegi
A Traefik local plugin SHALL import this module’s `simpleredis` package. `New` SHALL call `Init` only (no command, so Traefik still starts if Redis is late). Traefik SHALL start. A request through that plugin SHALL succeed. `useunsafe` MUST be false. That plugin MUST be a nested module, not this repo’s root `plugin.go`. The existing reclaim e2e compose project, Traefik container, ports 8000/8080, and routes `/a` `/b` MUST keep their reclaim semantics.

#### Scenario: Fake plugin starts without dialing
- **WHEN** Traefik v3.7.11 loads a local plugin whose `New` calls `SimpleRedis.Init`
- **AND** Redis is not yet accepting connections
- **THEN** Traefik’s API is reachable

#### Scenario: Request through the plugin succeeds
- **WHEN** Traefik has loaded that plugin
- **AND** compose Redis is reachable at `redis:6379` with no password
- **AND** a request is made on the plugin’s whoami route
- **THEN** the request succeeds
- **AND** reclaim routes `/a` and `/b` still succeed

#### Scenario: Reclaim whoami are not stopped for Redis proof
- **WHEN** the Redis Pester Describe runs
- **THEN** it does not stop `whoami-a` or `whoami-b`

### Requirement: Lost-reply Incr and Eval are proven on live Redis and Dragonfly
A request through the nested SimpleRedis Traefik plugin SHALL, in addition to the happy-path verbs, send Incr and Eval through a compose RESP drop-relay in front of that request’s engine (`redis:6379` or `dragonfly:6379`). The drop-relay SHALL drop INCR, INCRBY, or EVAL only after that TCP session has already forwarded at least one command (the probe warms with GET). A retry on a new session whose first command is INCR or EVAL SHALL pass the reply through. Other verbs SHALL pass through. The plugin SHALL set `X-SimpleRedis-DropIncr` to the integer after two applies (`2`), `X-SimpleRedis-DropIncrStored` to the stored value `2` read from the engine (not the drop-relay), `X-SimpleRedis-DropEval` to the integer after two applies of the Kong script (`6` when ARGV INCRBY is `3`), and `X-SimpleRedis-DropEvalStored` to that stored script result. Eval SHALL use a Lua 5.1-safe script that lists its key in KEYS. Happy-path Host stays `redis:6379` / `dragonfly:6379`. The Redis and Dragonfly Pester Describes MUST NOT stop `whoami-a` or `whoami-b`.

#### Scenario: Pester asserts lost-reply Incr and Eval on Redis
- **WHEN** a request is made on `/redis`
- **THEN** `X-SimpleRedis-DropIncr` is `2`
- **AND** `X-SimpleRedis-DropIncrStored` is `2`
- **AND** `X-SimpleRedis-DropEval` is `6`
- **AND** `X-SimpleRedis-DropEvalStored` is `6`
- **AND** the Redis Pester Describe does not stop `whoami-a` or `whoami-b`

#### Scenario: Pester asserts lost-reply Incr and Eval on Dragonfly
- **WHEN** a request is made on `/dragonfly`
- **THEN** `X-SimpleRedis-DropIncr` is `2`
- **AND** `X-SimpleRedis-DropIncrStored` is `2`
- **AND** `X-SimpleRedis-DropEval` is `6`
- **AND** `X-SimpleRedis-DropEvalStored` is `6`
- **AND** the Dragonfly Pester Describe does not stop `whoami-a` or `whoami-b`
