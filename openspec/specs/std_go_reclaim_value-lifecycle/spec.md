## Purpose

Defines the four events a value stored on the reclaim table receives — create, sleep, wake, close
— their order, the optional interfaces that carry them, and the guarantee that close is always
preceded by sleep so cleanup is never written twice.

## Requirements

### Requirement: A stored value receives four lifecycle events
The table SHALL drive a stored value through `create -> (sleep -> wake)* -> sleep -> close`.
`create` SHALL run once per incarnation, on the first `Open` for a key that finds it absent, and
the value SHALL come back awake. `sleep` SHALL run when the last holder's context is Done. `wake`
SHALL run when an `Open` arrives for a stored, sleeping value. `close` SHALL run once, when the
value is dropped for good. `sleep` and `wake` are a matched, repeating pair; `create` and `close`
happen once each. A value SHALL NOT receive `wake` without a preceding `sleep`, and SHALL NOT
receive two `sleep` calls without a `wake` between them.

#### Scenario: One incarnation across several sleep and wake cycles
- **WHEN** a key is opened, orphaned, and reopened within grace several times
- **THEN** `create` ran once
- **AND** the stored value received one `sleep` and one `wake` per cycle, alternating
- **AND** every `Open` returned the same value

#### Scenario: Create runs once per incarnation
- **WHEN** a key that is absent is opened
- **THEN** `create` runs once
- **AND** the value the caller receives has not been slept

### Requirement: Sleep keeps the value stored and keeps its identity
When the last holder's context is Done, the table SHALL call `sleep` on the stored value and
SHALL keep that value stored for the grace period. The value SHALL keep its identity: an `Open`
during that period SHALL return the same value, not a new one, and SHALL NOT run `create`.

#### Scenario: A sleeping value keeps its identity
- **WHEN** every holder for a key is Done and the value has been slept
- **AND** the key is opened again before grace ends
- **THEN** the same value is returned
- **AND** `create` does not run again

### Requirement: A caller never receives a sleeping value
`Open` SHALL NOT return a stored value before `wake` has returned for it. An `Open` that arrives
while another `Open`, a `sleep`, or a `create` is in flight for the same key SHALL wait for that
transition to finish before it decides what to do. `wake` SHALL NOT be able to fail: the table
offers no error path for it and never falls back to `create` when a value cannot resume. A value
that cannot guarantee resume SHALL NOT implement sleep and wake.

#### Scenario: Open returns only after wake returned
- **WHEN** a key holds a sleeping value whose `wake` blocks
- **AND** `Open` is called for that key
- **THEN** `Open` does not return until `wake` has returned
- **AND** the value it returns is awake

#### Scenario: Concurrent Opens on a waking value all wait
- **WHEN** several `Open` calls arrive for the same sleeping key at once
- **THEN** `wake` runs once
- **AND** every caller receives the same awake value

### Requirement: Close is always preceded by sleep
Every ending path SHALL call `sleep` before `close`, so `close` never has to handle the live
state and cleanup is not duplicated between the two. That holds when grace expires on a value
that is already sleeping (it SHALL NOT be slept twice), when the table is reset while the
incarnation is live (sleep, then close), and when grace is zero (create, sleep, close back to
back). At zero grace the value SHALL NOT be kept, because there is no window in which a sleeping
value could be woken.

#### Scenario: Grace expiry does not sleep a sleeping value twice
- **WHEN** the last holder for a key is Done and grace elapses without a new `Open`
- **THEN** the value received exactly one `sleep`
- **AND** `close` ran after that `sleep`

#### Scenario: Reset on a live incarnation sleeps before it closes
- **WHEN** the table is reset while a key still has a live holder
- **THEN** that value received `sleep` and then `close`, in that order

#### Scenario: Zero grace runs create, sleep, and close back to back
- **WHEN** a table with zero grace has its last holder for a key go Done
- **THEN** the value received `sleep` and then `close`
- **AND** the key is no longer stored

### Requirement: Lifecycle events are optional interfaces on the value
`sleep`, `wake`, and `close` SHALL be carried by optional interfaces on the stored value,
asserted the same way, so a value that implements none is unaffected and no new type is visible
across a package boundary. A value MAY implement any subset. `create` SHALL keep the signature
`func() (any, error)` and SHALL take no arguments. Lookups MUST use a type switch, not a
comma-ok assertion, so Yaegi does not panic the Traefik process.

#### Scenario: A value with no lifecycle methods still runs the full table lifecycle
- **WHEN** a value that implements none of the lifecycle methods is stored and later ends
- **THEN** the table completes the incarnation without error
- **AND** it still reports the end

#### Scenario: A value that implements only close is unaffected
- **WHEN** a value implements `close` but neither `sleep` nor `wake`
- **AND** its key is orphaned and grace elapses
- **THEN** `close` is called exactly once

#### Scenario: Compiled tests observe all four events
- **WHEN** a value implements sleep, wake, and close and is exercised with `go test`
- **THEN** create, sleep, wake, and close run in the order this spec requires
